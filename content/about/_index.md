    InspireLabs is a student-led nonprofit on a mission to ignite curiosity and confidence in elementary school students through hands-on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    We believe early exposure to STEM fosters problem-solving, creativity, and long-term interest in innovation. From community expos to school-based workshops and mentorship, our goal is to make STEM fun and accessible — especially for underserved communities.

    We are proudly partnered with NASA Astro Camp® and supported by local STEM professionals, educators, and volunteers across the region.
